This repo contains the codes and slides from Blake's COMP2521 tutorials.

The **Tuesday** folder contains the completed code files from the T09A class, and the **Friday** folder contains the files from F13B.

The **Templates** folder contains the starter code for the tasks, so you can try the exercises yourself.

The slides are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13mfQPRtSWNZ8rk4gMcZvqdgBOWPAPulh?usp=sharing).
